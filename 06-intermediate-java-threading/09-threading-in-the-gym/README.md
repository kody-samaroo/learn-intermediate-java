### Threading in the Gym

It‚Äôs time to go to the gym and get THREADED!!! üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãüèøüí™üèΩ

In this project, you will be creating a program to represent a gym. We have provided you with some supporting files to build the backbone of the gym, but you will be doing most of the heavy lifting. Don‚Äôt worry, the gym puns will definitely continue. üòâ

In this gym, we want all of our members to be able to work out at the same time instead of waiting in line outside until the person in front of them is done. To solve this problem, we will implement a thread for each member so they can all work out concurrently.

Let‚Äôs get started!

#### Supporting Files
1. Review Member.java
2. Review Exercise.java
3. Review MachineType.java
4. Review Weight.java

#### Starting a Gym
5. Navigate back to Gym.java. Here, you will see an empty class waiting for you to build your gym‚Äôs foundation, feel free to declutter your IDE by closing the other files if you want, we won‚Äôt be making any changes inside of them.

    Inside this class, create two instance variables:

    totalGymMembers, which should be a private final int.
    availableMachines, which should be a private Map<MachineType, Integer>.
6. Since the Map class is part of java.util, you need to add an import statement so your program knows where to look to find the Map functionality.

7. Create a constructor for the Gym class with two parameters. Inside this constructor, initialize totalGymMembers and availableMachines.

#### Opening a Gym
8. Create a new public method, openForTheDay(), that has no parameters and doesn‚Äôt return anything. Leave the method empty for now.

9. Inside openForTheDay(), declare a List of Threads called gymMembersRoutines. Do not initialize gymMembersRoutines to anything yet. We‚Äôll do that next.

    This variable is going to hold the members of our gym and the routines that they are going to do for the day. Each member and their routine combination will be run as a separate thread.

    You will also need to add an import statement for List, do you remember what package it is in?

10. To create the threads for the gymMembersRoutines, we are going to create an IntStream. This stream will be the range from 1 to the number of members in our gym. These will be ids for the members. For each integer in the range, we are going to map it to a corresponding object. This mapping method takes a lambda as a parameter. At the end of the mapping function, we will collect the objects and put them in the gymMembersRoutines list.

    For now:

    - Set gymMembersRoutines equal to an IntStream
    - Chain the rangeClosed() method of the IntStream, beginning at 1 and running up to and inclusively, of this.totalGymMembers.
    - Method chain the intermediate function mapToObj() method of the range function. Leave the method parameters empty for now.
    - Add an import statement for IntStream: import java.util.stream.IntStream;

11. Now, as mentioned in the previous task, the mapToObj() method is an intermediate function, which means it cannot be the last method in a chain of methods. It is simply meant to pass off objects to another method for further processing.

    Remove the trailing semicolon from the mapToObj() and chain another method, this one a terminal function, .collect(). Pass in Collectors.toList() to the collect() method.

    You‚Äôll need to import the Collectors class from java.util.stream as well.

12. As mentioned in Task 10, mapToObj() is an intermediate function, takes a lambda, and returns a new stream to the next chained function. Inside the parameters of this function, add an empty lambda that passes one parameter, id, into the lambda. The lambda is supposed to return objects to the next function, but we‚Äôll set the return function up over the next few tasks. Leave the body empty for now.

    This will challenge your organization and whitespace management. Try to make your code as readable as possible. See the hint for our technique.

13. Inside the lambda, create a new Member variable called member, passing in the id variable from the lambda parameters into the Member constructor.

14. Now that we have a way to create all our members, we will create a thread for each of the routines that the members will be performing. These threads are what we will collect and place in the gymMembersRoutines list.

    After the creation of the new member, add a return statement.

15. Instead of an empty return statement, return a new Thread(). Inside the constructor create a new lambda with no parameters. Leave the lambda body empty for now.

16. Inside the lambda, add a try-catch block to catch the generic Exception e.

17. Inside the try block, call the performRoutine() of member. Inside the catch block, print out the exception that was caught.

    This completes our gymMemberRoutines list as we have now created the Threads we will fill the list with.

18. Now that our list of threads, gymMembersRoutines, is complete, we‚Äôre ready to do something with it! On the next line, after the completion of the collect() method, iterate over each item in the list using the forEach() method. This method takes a consumer function, a type of function that takes in an object and returns nothing. We‚Äôll implement this using method referencing, which is a technique that is used when a lambda function does nothing more than call a method that already exists for the class.Start the thread by calling the Thread‚Äòs start() method. Check the hint for the syntax.

#### Supervising The Gym Members
19. Now we need to create the thread that is going to supervise all of our gym members. Create a new private method called createSupervisor(). It will return a Thread and has one parameter: a List of Threads called threads. Leave the method body empty for now.

20. Inside the new method, create a new Thread called supervisor and set this equal to a new Thread. Inside the constructor, add a lambda that has no parameters, and leave the lambda body empty. Return the supervisor Thread from the method.

21. Inside the lambda, create a while loop that runs while true (forever until we break the loop). This can be done by passing the boolean literal true to the while loop condition.

22. Inside the while loop, create a new list of Strings called runningThreads. This will be another collection gathered from a stream. We‚Äôre going to give you the basic procedures, let‚Äôs see if you can string them together properly. If you run into issues, check the hint to see how we implemented the solution.

    - Create a stream from the threads argument using stream().
    - Filter the stream of threads based on if the thread is alive or not.
    - Since the result of the stream is currently still Threads and we need Strings, map the result, getting the Thread‚Äòs name using the getName() method.
    - Collect the resulting map into a list using Collectors.toList()

23. After you have completed runningThreads, add a call to System.out.println();. We will use this message to act as a message from our gym staff to report how many people are still working out and list the list of threads.

    Inside the print statement:

    - Print the current thread‚Äôs name (hint)
    - Display the current number of members working out (how many items are still in runningThreads) along with a short phrase explaining the number (i.e. ‚Äú8 people still working out‚Äù)
    - Print the list of members (runningThreads) still working out

24. If you remember, our while loop is set to run forever. This is a really bad thing, let‚Äôs fix that. Create an if statement inside the while loop that breaks the loop if the list of runningThreads is empty.

25. After the if statement but still inside the while loop, create a try-catch block. Inside the try block, call the static Thread method sleep() for 1000 milliseconds. Catch the InterruptedException as e and print it to the user if there is an error.

26. After the while loop, print the current thread‚Äôs name again and also a message saying that all threads have completed.

27. Now, outside of the lambda but before our return supervisor; line, set the name of the supervisor thread to Gym Staff.

#### Adding Staff to the Gym
28. Now that we have our gym staff, go back to the openForTheDay() method. Before the final forEach iterator that starts all of the gymMembersRoutines, declare a new Thread called supervisor, initialize it to the result of calling our .createSupervisor() method, passing in the gymMemberRoutines.

29. Make a call to start the supervisor Thread you just created.

#### Main Method
30. Create the main() method. Inside the main() method, create a new Gym. Give your gym a name and add as many members as you want. We suggest five. For the availableMachines Map parameter, use the following syntax to create a new HashMap in place:
```
Gym globoGym = new Gym(5, new HashMap<>() {
  {
    put(MachineType.LEGPRESSMACHINE, 5);
    put(MachineType.BARBELL, 5);
    put(MachineType.SQUATMACHINE, 5);
    put(MachineType.LEGEXTENSIONMACHINE, 5);
    put(MachineType.LEGCURLMACHINE, 5);
    put(MachineType.LATPULLDOWNMACHINE, 5);
    put(MachineType.CABLECROSSOVERMACHINE, 5);
  }
});
```
Add an import statement for HashMap:
```
import java.util.HashMap;
```

31. Now call the openForTheDay() method on your gym. Compile all the files (javac *.java) in the terminal and then run the Gym class (java Gym) to see all of your gym members begin working out for the day.

#### Additional Challenges
32. Consider adding synchronizing capabilities to your Gym. Right now, there are no limitations on equipment and multiple members can use the same machine at the same time. We also have a finite number of weights in the gym. Right now, we don‚Äôt take that into account when a member begins their exercises. How can we make them wait for weights to be returned by the current users?
