###### NESTED CLASSES: LESSON

### Review

You made it! Letâ€™s review what we have learned so far!

There are two main types of nested classes: non-static (also known as inner) nested classes, and static nested classes
Nested classes provide an extra level of security by giving programmers the power to control the amount of access one class may have to another class and its methods.
Non-static (inner) nested classes have the capability of accessing other static and non-static members whereas static nested classes may only access other static members of their enclosing class.
Shadowing refers to the practice of having variables and methods of the same name exist within nested classes. Shadowing results in overlap, and is managed using the keyword this to determine which version of the variable or method is being used.
